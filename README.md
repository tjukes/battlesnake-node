##### documentation

To compile docs,
`npm run docs`
Add documentation in the JSdoc format, found [here](http://usejsdoc.org/about-getting-started.html)

If you wish to edit the README, please do so on the README_snakespeare.md file.  It is used to autogenerate the README.md, so anything you add to README.md will be overwritten each time `npm run docs` is run.

The documentation.yml file is for configuring the documentation generator.

#### git-stuff

Use branches for feature development or personal experimentation: `git checkout -b some-new-branch-name`

Merge to master via Github pull requests.

#### testing

To run tests,
`npm test`

### Deploying to Heroku

Current Heroku deployment: <http://this-snake.herokuapp.com/>

Can be updated or replaced as development progresses.

## Docs from starter-snake

### battlesnake-node(js)

A simple [BattleSnake AI](http://battlesnake.io) written in Javascript for NodeJS. Founded on the [Sendwithus starter snake](https://github.com/sendwithus/battlesnake-node)

### Getting started (from Sendwithus)

See <https://github.com/sendwithus/battlesnake-node> for full details or to start a new snake from a blank slate.

To get started you'll need a working NodeJS development environment, and at least read the Heroku docs on [deploying a NodeJS app](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs).

If you haven't setup a NodeJS development environment before, read [how to get started with NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/documentation/tutorials/). You'll also need [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for easy JS dependency management.

This client uses [Express4](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html) for easy route management, read up on the docs to learn more about reading incoming JSON params, writing responses, etc.

### Running the AI locally

Clone this repo via HTTPS or SSH.

Install the client dependencies:

    npm install

Create an `.env` file in the root of the project and add your environment variables (optional).

Run the server:

    nf start web

Test the client in your browser: <http://localhost:5000>

## API

## simple

Weighting scheme will assign 1 to edges going out
to vertices which are unoccupied

**Parameters**

-   `v1` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** edge starts at this vertex
-   `v2` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** edge goes to this vertex
-   `graph`  

Returns **[number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)** weight

## Board

Class represents the board

### constructor

Create a board object.
The board will keep track of the request information
and keep the game states and other useful useful information
infered from the current state.

**Parameters**

-   `body` **[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** the body of the request

### createGraph

Creates a graph of the board.
 See API of [Graph.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graph.js#Graph+toJSON)

**Parameters**

-   `grid` **[Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)&lt;[Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)>** the grid of snakes
-   `rule` **[function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)?** This is how we assign weights to edges between the cells of the board.
    default sets all edges to open vertices value 0) w/ edge weight 1, 0 otherwise (optional, default `simple`)

Returns **Graph** 

## \_equiDistant

Looks for set of cells that are or distance n from the head
Disregards all other snakes on board.  Might return negative indices.

**Parameters**

-   `head`  
-   `distance`  
-   `height`  
-   `width`  

## equiDistantFromHead

Looks for set of cells that are or distance n from the head
Disregards all other snakes on board.  Doesn't return negative indices.

**Parameters**

-   `head`  
-   `distance`  
-   `height`  
-   `width`  

## searchBoard

Search
First search all of moves keeping other snakes fixed.  Can go deeper
Then choose closest head, and if it is within the search depth\*2,
 and search all combinations of all snakes heads
mark all paths that give death as negative score

## searchHeads

Takes at where other snake's heads might be in the short term.

**Parameters**

-   `Board` **[Board](#board)** 
-   `turns` **integer** how many turns to look at into the future.
    Keep in mind that we shouldn't look too far, because this is O(3^n).  Eek!
-   `reqBody`  
-   `board`  

## checkMate

Check if next move could result in checkmate.

## dijkstra

Find shortest path by dijkstra's algorithm given changing graph values

**Parameters**

-   `startVertex` **[Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)&lt;integer>** , [l,m]
-   `endVertex` **[Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)&lt;integer>** 
-   `graph` **Graph** 
-   `board`  

## aStar

Finds shortests path, faster normally the dijkstra's algorithm

**Parameters**

-   `graph` **Graph** 
-   `startVertex` **[Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)&lt;integer>** 
-   `endVertex` **[Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)&lt;integer>** 

## getNeighboursIndex

Returns an object with values indices[l,m] of neighbours
that aren't other snakes

**Parameters**

-   `i` **integer** row index
-   `j` **integer** col index
-   `grid` **[Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)&lt;[Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)>** 

## checkTailGrowth

Keeps track of when another snake eats, and
if planning on going into last element of tail, abort!

**Parameters**

-   `board` **[Board](#board)** 

## taxiDistance

Calculates taxi-car distance between two points

**Parameters**

-   `startVertex`  
-   `endVertex`
